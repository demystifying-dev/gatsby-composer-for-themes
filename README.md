## Gatsby Composer for Themes

A yarn workspaces composed space for developing, running and testing your Gatsby themes.

Based on [Composable yarn workspaces by @ChristopherBiscardi](https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/composing-yarn-workspaces) where you simply nest git repos that couldn't care less about each other :), and we've added a demo theme runner!
